        <h2>To My Purple Panda 💜🐼</h2>
        <p>Every moment with you feels like magic wrapped in pink skies and soft cuddles. I made this little space to hold pieces of my heart for you—because you deserve a love that shows up, glows up, and never gives up. 💗</p>
        <p>You're the peace to my chaos, the childlike joy in my everyday, and the only panda I’d get kidnapped by. 🐼💕</p>
